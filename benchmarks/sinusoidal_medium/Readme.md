# Sinusoidal Large
Sinusoidal test case parameters to occupy a significant amount of memory while being relatively square in X-Y.
Attempts to fill 50% of the recommended maximum memory allocation of 168 GiB on the UArizona Ocelote HPC system.

* Sinusoidal Parameters:
  + Number Cells X: 3500
  + Number Cells Y: 3741
  + Number Cells Z: 5
* Observed metrics (On Ocelote with 2 timesteps and (1,1,1) process topology):
  + Memory Occupation: 84.02 GiB (88096660 KiB) (50.01% of Ocelote recommended maximum memory allocation)
  + Runtime: 00:14:12.66 (852.66 seconds)
